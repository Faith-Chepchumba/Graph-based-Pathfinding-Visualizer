# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Overview

This project visualizes common pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A**) on a grid. Users can place obstacles and choose a start and end point to see how the algorithms work.*

*## Features*

- *Dijkstra's Algorithm*
- *A** Algorithm
- BFS (can be added similarly)
- Interactive grid system

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run `main.py` to start the visualizer.

3. Click to place start, goal, and obstacles.
